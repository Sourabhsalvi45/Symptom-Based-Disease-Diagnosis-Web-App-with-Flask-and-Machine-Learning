# 🩺 Symptom-Based Disease Diagnosis Web App with Flask and Machine Learning

In the age of digital healthcare, timely access to accurate medical information is vital.  
This project introduces a **Symptom-Based Disease Diagnosis Web App** that leverages **Flask** and **Machine Learning** to assist users in identifying possible health conditions based on their symptoms.

The core of the system is a **Decision Tree Classifier model** trained on a dataset mapping symptoms to diseases.  
Users can input their symptoms through a simple web interface, and the app will predict the most probable disease.  

Alongside predictions, the system provides:
- 📝 Disease descriptions  
- 🛡️ Precautions  
- 💊 Recommended medications  
- 🥗 Dietary suggestions  
- 🏃 Workout tips  

This project bridges the gap between **technology and healthcare**, offering a convenient and educational solution for quick health insights.
